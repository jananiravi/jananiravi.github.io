# About me

I am a computational biologist ([Dept. of Pathobiology and Diagnostic Investigation](https://cvm.msu.edu/pdi), [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/)) working on host-pathogen biology, protein sequence-structure-function relationships, and drug repurposing. I am interested in quantitative biology, like to code & develop methods, and enjoy being in a collaborative environment addressing interesting biological questions.

I also like teaching statistical data analysis and visualization, and R/Python programming. I recently founded the [R-Ladies East Lansing chapter](/post/2018/rladies-elansing) & look forward to hosting our first meeting.

I love to [read](/interests/reading) most non-fiction genres, sing classical carnatic music & dabble in keyboard, guitar!
