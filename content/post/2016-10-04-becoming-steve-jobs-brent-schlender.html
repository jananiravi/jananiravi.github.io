<p><a href="http://becomingstevejobs.com/">Becoming Steve Jobs <em>by</em> Brent Schlender</a> is a well-written biography of Steve Jobs &amp; is definitely much better than Walter Isaacson’s ‘official’ one! And yeah, it is much more than a boring compendium of wiki and news articles. :)</p>
<p><em>So, happy reading!</em></p>
