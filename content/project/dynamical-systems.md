## Research
During [my graduate research with Dr John Tyson](http://mpf.biol.vt.edu/lab_website/people/Janani_Ravi/), I built mathematical models to understand dynamical aspects:

* Modeling the START transition in the budding yeast cell cycle:
	* Built a detailed mathematical model (~100 ODEs, ~150 parameters) for the START transition in yeast and
integrated it with our published model of the whole cell cycle.
	* Model addresses outstanding issues related to the precise mechanism and timing of transcriptional, post-
translational and localization events, as well as size control under varying growth conditions.
	* Model consistent with ~200 experimental mutant phenotypes pertaining to the START transition and rest of
the cell cycle.
	* Built a basic model for the nutritional effect of size control in budding yeast cells.
	* This mechanism has been incorporated into the existing model of the yeast cell cycle to explain an initial
set of START mutants.

* Modeling bistability in the canonical Wnt pathway:
	* Built a simplified model based upon the core module of the Wnt canonical pathway, and incorporated
additional key regulatory interactions.
	* Model shows that the Wnt signaling pathway can display bistability, in agreement with preliminary
experimental results.
